# Assignment 4

This was supposed to be an extension of assignment three, which would alphabetically sort stored contacts and display them as a list for the user to read.
This didn't work out. The problem seems to be that fread() can't return valid ASCII, although if I recall correctly this version wrote the data to the file
in the expected fashion.

I might even get around to figuring out what I did wrong some day.
